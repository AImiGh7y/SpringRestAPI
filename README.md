# Spring Rest API

## Description
The SpringRestAPI project is a REST API application developed using Spring Boot framework. Basically it's a mini project that I created to understand how Rest APIs work. This API provides a set of RESTful web services for flexible and efficient data interactions using Spring Data JPA (this is before updating to Spring DATA REST which simplifies (by a lot) the development of RESTful APIs for data-driven applications).

Additionally, Rest API security has been implemented to enhance the overall security posture of the application, ensuring robust protection of sensitive data and endpoints.

## Key Features
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on data.
- Utilizes Spring Boot to facilitate development and maintenance.
- Implements the Rest-Service-DAO model for efficient data management.
- Offers carefully designed endpoints for data interactions and manipulation.
- Utilizes modern technologies to ensure high performance and reliability.
